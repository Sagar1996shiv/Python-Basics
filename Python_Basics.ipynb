        "      - Python is interpreted, meaning code is executed line by line. This makes debugging easier and development faster.Easily integrates with other languages like C, C++, Java, and .NET.ython abstracts many low-level details, such as memory management, so developers can focus on solving problems rather than dealing with the underlying hardware.\n",
        "2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a\n",
        "program\n",
        "   - Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. These keywords define the syntax and structure of Python programs and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.\n",
        "   Control the flow of the program (e.g., if, else, for, while)\n",
        " 3. Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples\n",
        "    - Feature\t         Mutable Objects vs Immutable Objects\n",
        "Can change after creation -\t Yes\t            No\n",
        "Stored in memory - Changes happen in-place\t  A new object is created on change\n",
        "Examples\t  -   list, dict, set, bytearray\t  int, float, str, tuple, bool, frozenset\n",
        "Performance\t- Slightly slower in hashing contexts\t  Faster and safer for keys, caching  \n",
